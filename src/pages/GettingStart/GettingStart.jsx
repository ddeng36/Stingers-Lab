            <Question>How do I get involved?</Question>
            <Answer>
              <i>Active Students:</i> First, you must complete the safety
              training. Then, you can come to the space during open hours and
              ask a staff member to help you get started. The MakerSpace door
              shall only be locked and unlocked by MakerSpace staff.
            </Answer>
            <Answer>
              <i>Faculty and Staff: </i>Please give us 2 weeks' notice so that
              we can work with you to accommodate your class. We can help
              provide machine trainings and organize resources. We will also add
              your class time to our calendar to notify other users. This
              ensures that the Makerspace remains accessible to everyone.
              Classes that utilize the Makerspace without proper notification
              will be asked to leave until they submit a request through the
              appropriate channels, allowing us to assess how the Makerspace can
              best fulfill their needs.
